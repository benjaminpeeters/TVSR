Description: The package includes two main functions to estimate time-varying spatial regression models. The first performs the Local-Kernel Spatial Regression (LKSR), a semi-parametric estimation procedure based on local maximization of a log-likelihood function. The second method is the Score-Driven Spatial Regression (SDSR), which implements a score-driven approach (Based on Blasquez, 2016). Initially, these programs were coded to assess international monetary spillovers between 1980 and 2020. The reference paper is Peeters, Girard and Gnabo (forthcoming).
