R/TVSR is an R package including two main functions to estimate time-varying spatial regression models: LKSR and SDSR. 

1/ the Local-Kernel Spatial Regression (LKSR) is a semi-parametric estimation procedure based on local maximization of a log-likelihood function. 

2/ the Score-Driven Spatial Regression (SDSR) implements a score-driven approach (based on Blasquez, 2016). 

Initially, these programs were coded to assess international monetary spillovers between 1980 and 2020.
